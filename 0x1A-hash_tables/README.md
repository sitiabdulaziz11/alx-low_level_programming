project 0x1A. C - Hash tables

Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What is a hash function
What makes a good hash function
What is a hash table, how do they work and how to use them
What is a collision and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table
What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
What are the most common use cases of hash tables

Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
You are allowed to use the C standard library
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called hash_tables.h
Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded

Data Structures
Please use these data structures for this project:

/**
 * struct hash_node_s - Node of a hash table
 *
 * @key: The key, string
 * The key is unique in the HashTable
 * @value: The value corresponding to a key
 * @next: A pointer to the next node of the List
 */
typedef struct hash_node_s
{
     char *key;
     char *value;
     struct hash_node_s *next;
} hash_node_t;

/**
 * struct hash_table_s - Hash table data structure
 *
 * @size: The size of the array
 * @array: An array of size @size
 * Each cell of this array is a pointer to the first node of a linked list,
 * because we want our HashTable to use a Chaining collision handling
 */
typedef struct hash_table_s
{
     unsigned long int size;
     hash_node_t **array;
} hash_table_t;
